# LeetCode

Use `leetcode-cli` and `jest` to make it easier to play with LeetCode.

You can just write the jest test in your file (see the examples in `src` directory), and use `npm run submit` to submit your solution. The jest test will automatically be disabled in the submit content.

## Usage

- `npm install`
<!-- - `npm run login` to sign in with your leetcode account -->
- `npm run easy` to get an easy problem
- `npm run medium` to get a medium problem
- `npm run hard` to get a hard problem
- `npm run test src/1.two-sum.js` to run jest test
- `npm run submit src/1.two-sum.js` to submit the problem
